# Sentiment Analysis using Python

This repository contains the source code for a Python Project which aims at determining the sentiment of the user while writing through the given input. Along with this, it also
has a RegEx Checker and WordCloud generator, which can help in fine tuning the model.

This is implemented as a website using Flask framework.
